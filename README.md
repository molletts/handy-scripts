# handy-scripts

Miscellaneous scripts that I've cobbled together over time. Never intended for public consumption, they tend to be ugly, poorly-documented and lacking in error-checking.

## Yahoo-Groups-photo-downloader

A tool to download photos from Yahoo Groups. Can retrieve information about albums and photos and optionally save it as a CSV file. The script can download individual photos, all photos in an album or all photos in the group.

Written in a hurry to salvage content prior to the shutdown of Yahoo! Groups. Will probably cease to be useful after December 2019.

## cut-video

A tool for quick & dirty "topping and tailing" of long video files into separate shorter ones.
